I am PhD in (Bio)Physics of the University of Bucharest, Romania. I came at PVAMU CRI-CCSB attracted by the research conditions offered by the generous budget, space and support (and also to be closer to my daughter and grandchildren). I brought a fully equipped (~$150,000) microarray laboratory and the experience of 37 years on faculty positions at 2 major medical schools from Romania (1981-2001 at Carol Davila and Ovidius) and 2 from NY (2001-1013 at Albert Einstein College of Medicine (AECOM) and 2013-2017 at New York Medical College). Since 2001, when immigrated in the USA with an O1 (outstanding) visa sponsored by AECOM, I have received over $14M research funding. I was involved in all branches of genomics research: technology development, optimization of experimental design and wet protocols, taking care of lab animal colonies and cell cultures, performing experiments, data analysis and development of new algorithms, analytical tools and software. 


I have 3 patents in microelectrophysiology, 7 books (22 editions in Romanian, English, Spanish and Greek), 83 peer-reviewed articles (12 as single author, 38 as first author and 11 as last author), 25 book chapters and conference proceedings. 73 genomic data sets were deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) of the NIH National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). I gave invited talks and seminars at academic institutions (from Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, England, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Panama, Portugal, Romania, Sweden, USA, Venezuela) and numerous talk-shows at (Romanian) national and local television and radio stations. I was an active presence in the Romanian media with columns on scientific, political and social subjects and led a national program against domestic violence. In 1987 I even had for few months a weekly one hour broadcasting at Romanian national television with “Universe, Matter, Life”. My writings include also 3 philosophical novels, countless poetry and essays, and a drama sequel and 2 musicals played by student theaters.
