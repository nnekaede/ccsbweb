## Blog

Each blog post is a Markdown file in [`blog/_posts/`](https://github.com/skimlab/ccsbweb/tree/master/blog/_posts).  File names have post date and a short title.  The short title is used for permanent URL links, so must be unique to each blog post.  For example: [`2018-05-03-ccsb-signage-up.md`](https://github.com/skimlab/ccsbweb/blob/master/blog/_posts/2018-05-03-ccsb-signage-up.md).  Posts have the following YAML top matter:

```
---
layout: post
title: CCSB Signage Goes Up
author: Seungchan Kim
image: /images/blog/2018-05-03-ccsb-signage-up/ccsb_signage.png
---
```

Tags `layout`, `title` and `author` are required, while `image` is optional.  The author name should correspond to the team member `title` tag for proper linking of posts to authors.  All blog images should live in [`images/blog/`](https://github.com/skimlab/ccsbweb/tree/master/images/blog) and be referred as relative to the base directory, begining with `/images/`.

## Papers

Each paper lives in [`papers/_posts/`](https://github.com/skimlab/ccsbweb/tree/master/papers/_posts).  File names, used to construct permalinks, are first author plus short (1-2 word) title, for example [`2017-05-31-tran-contextualization-drug.md`](https://github.com/skimlab/ccsbweb/tree/master/papers/_posts/2017-05-31-tran-contextualization-drug.md).   Papers have the following YAML metadata:

```
