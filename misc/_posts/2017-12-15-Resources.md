## Facilities and Research Environment

**Laboratory**: 
The Kim lab is a member of the Center for Computational Systems Biology at Prairie View A&M University funded by the Texas A&M Chancellor’s Research Initiative (CRI).  The center brings together faculty in Electrical and Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Mathematics, Agriculture and Biology to accelerate biomedical informatics research, train students and commercialize discoveries.

The Cell Biology Lab and Next Generation Sequencing Center supports the Center for Computational Systems Biology at Prairie View A&M University to further the research of all Center Investigators and the wider scientific community.  The Cell Biology and Sequencing Center share 1,612 square feet of wet lab space.  The wet lab is equipped for molecular and cellular studies and can validate computational results.  The sequencing center is equipped with short read technologies for targeted re-sequencing, expression studies and transcriptome analysis.  It also offers microarray technologies to analyze RNA expression and analysis of data.  

There is a tissue culture room, large equipment room and general lab with areas for the sequencing center, molecular biology, cell biology and microarray processing and analysis.  It contains standard laboratory equipment (stir plates, pH meter, vortexers, scales, water bath, centrifuges, shakers, autoclave, biosafety cabinet, incubators, chemical fume hood, refrigerators, freezers, -80ºC freezers and a Millipore water ultra-purification system), as well as equipment for protein and nucleic acid electrophoresis and detection, real-time PCR and microarray processing and analysis.  There is a 576 sq ft dedicated conference room adjoining the labs.

**The Next Gen Sequencing Center** 
<img align="right" src={{ site.baseurl }}{{"/images/misc/resources/CCSB-NextSeq550.png"}} style="float: right; width: 320px">
offers Illumina sequencing by synthesis.  It is equipped to isolate, quantitate, evaluate quality of nucleic acid preparations and prepare libraries for sequencing using a workflow that minimizes contamination.  The Illumina sequencer is covered under an annually renewed PROD Care NSQ 550 Comprehensive service contract through Illumina. It guarantees an average 3 business day on-site response time by a field engineer, full coverage on parts and labor, and an annual preventative maintenance visit.  The center also offers microarray processing and analysis.  We will train, support, and provide fee-for-service work, access to ancillary equipment for sample preparation and bioinformatics support to Center investigators and the wider scientific community.

**Next Generation Sequencing Data Specific Computing Resources**: 
Resources specifically dedicated to the handling and analysis of DNA and/or RNA sequencing includes: BaseSpace Sequencing Hub with unlimited storage and computing and an in-house analytical pipeline to analyze NGS data.

**The Cell/Molecular Biology Lab** is equipped to study the function of gene products implicated in pathological processes.  Facilities and experience in use of viral and mammalian expression vectors are in place.

**Computer Resources**: The lab has a dedicated 27” iMAC 16GB RAM workstation to process Bioanalyzer and Nanodrop data and a color inkjet printer.
